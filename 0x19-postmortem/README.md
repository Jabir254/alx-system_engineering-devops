Postmortem: Web Stack Outage

Issue Summary:
Duration: June 8, 2023, 10:00 AM to June 8, 2023, 12:00 PM (UTC)
Impact: The web application experienced intermittent downtime, resulting in slow response times and occasional errors for approximately 30% of users.

Timeline:
- 10:00 AM: The issue was detected when an engineer received an alert indicating high error rates and increased latency in the web application.
- 10:05 AM: The team started investigating the issue, focusing initially on the application servers.
- 10:15 AM: Assumptions were made that the issue might be related to the database due to high read query latencies.
- 10:30 AM: A few database queries were optimized to improve performance, but the issue persisted.
- 10:45 AM: Another team was notified and joined the investigation to examine the network infrastructure.
- 11:00 AM: The network team found no abnormalities and suspected that the issue might be related to the load balancer.
- 11:15 AM: Debugging efforts were diverted towards the load balancer, but no conclusive evidence of misconfiguration or overload was found.
- 11:30 AM: As the issue persisted, the incident was escalated to the senior engineering manager and the operations director.
- 11:45 AM: A full-scale system-wide investigation was initiated, involving all teams and individuals.
- 12:00 PM: The root cause was identified and the incident was resolved.

Root Cause and Resolution:
The root cause of the web stack outage was determined to be a misconfigured caching layer. The caching layer was designed to improve performance by storing frequently accessed data. However, a recent deployment introduced a misconfiguration that caused the cache to serve stale data, resulting in inconsistent and erroneous responses.

To resolve the issue, the misconfiguration was corrected, and the cache was purged to ensure fresh data retrieval. Additionally, the deployment process was enhanced to include thorough testing and validation of the caching layer to prevent similar misconfigurations in the future.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:
1. Enhance deployment process: Implement rigorous testing and validation steps specifically focused on critical components such as the caching layer to minimize the chances of misconfigurations.
2. Improve monitoring and alerting: Enhance the monitoring system to provide early detection of caching-related issues, including detecting stale data serving or inconsistencies.
3. Automated cache purging: Develop an automated mechanism to periodically clear the cache or perform cache validation to ensure data integrity.
4. Load testing and capacity planning: Conduct regular load testing exercises to identify potential bottlenecks and ensure the system can handle increased traffic and user load without performance degradation.
5. Incident response training: Organize training sessions to improve incident response coordination and enable quicker escalations when necessary.
6. Post-deployment validation: Implement a process to validate critical system functionalities after each deployment to catch any misconfigurations or regressions.

By addressing these measures, we aim to enhance the stability and reliability of the web stack, reducing the likelihood and impact of similar outages in the future.
